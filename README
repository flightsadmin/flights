A Laravel Livewire Flight Management Module with User Management Dashboard using Spatie Laravel Permission.
Package is autoloaded as per PSR-4 autoloading in any laravel version `^9.19` so no extra config required.
It uses ***auth*** middleware thus installs `laravel/ui` just incase you don't have any other auth mechanism, this does not mean you have to use `laravel/ui`.

## Installation

You can install the package via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require flightsadmin/flights
```

## Usage

After running `composer require flightsadmin/flights` command just run:

```bash
php artisan flight:install
```
**This command will perfom below actions:

    * Compile css/js based on `bootstrap and bootstrap-icons using vite`.
    * Run `npm install && run build`
    * Flush *node_modules* files from your folder.

If you choose to scaffold authentication this command will run `php artisan ui:auth`
to generate Auth scaffolds using `laravel/ui` package. You can skip this step if your app has authentication already.
